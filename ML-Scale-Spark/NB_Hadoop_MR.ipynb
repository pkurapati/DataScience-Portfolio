    "### Q1 Student Answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> __a)__ Hadoop MapReduce follows \"functional programming\" paradigm. In functional programming, we have higher order functions that can take other low order functions as arguments. In MapReduce, we have mappers and reducers that are higher order functions. A mapper takes as an argument a function, say 'f' and applies it to all the elements of the list it gets as input. Since the function 'f' does not depend on any thing else other than its input one can easily parallelize this by running multiple higher order mappers. Similarly a reducer applies a  function, say 'g', to all the elements it gets as inputs in order to aggregate and provide the final result. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ In order to avoid the complexity of a reducer in aggregating the results, Hadoop MapReduce framework gaurantees a sorted list of data to reducers. The process of taking output from each mapper and sorting them before handing it to reducers is called shuffling. In order to sort the data, Hadoop needs to move the data from the mappers which can be an expensive disk I/O and Networking operation. One optimization that can be done is to use a combiner which is a method of local aggregation. For eg., in a word-count problem, a combiner will aggregate each key count locally per mapper, there by the amount of intermediate key-value pairs is at the most equal to the number of unique keys.   \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ Hadoop framework considers combiner as an optimization function. As such, there is no guarantee on how many times a combiner is applied or if it is applied at all. In other words, a combiner is treated as a bump-in-a-wire between mapper and reducer. So the input/output format of combiner must always match the output of the mapper which is in the form of key-value pair. The reducer code must not change with the presence/absence of combiner and expects the same key-value pair format.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ A user can control the below:\n",
    "* Specify number of mappers or reducers. Right number of mappers is <100.\n",
    "* Can specify initialization code at the beginning of the mapper\n",
    "* Can specify termination code at the end of map or reduce task\n",
    "* Control the sort order of the intermediate keys (produced by the mapper/combiner) \n",
    "* Control the partitioning of the key space, and hence the set of keys processed by a reducer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Moore's law started to decline where the processing speeds no longer double every year. So, instead of developing a custom scale-up solution which is expensive, people started to look for scale-out designs. Evolution of commoditized servers that are built on standard components for processing, storage and networking helped scale-out further. Volume drove the cost of cheaper servers down. Applications are being developed to take advantage of scale-out model for parallelism and resiliency.   "

    "\n",
    "> __a)__ In Hadoop framework, counters are used to maintain statistics of common parameters used in mappers or reducers. For example, Hadoop framework provides built-in counters for number of mappers or reducers, number of records in and out of mapper or reducer, CPU and memory utilized etc. We can also create custom counters by declaring a global variable and updating it based on some custom conditions. Hadoop framework aggregates these global counters across mappers and reducers and make sure it is available at the end of the job. This is very useful for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ A composite key consists of multiple keys that are joined together. We can use composite keys for secondary sorting, whenever there is a need to do a sort based on primary key and a subsequent sort based on the value. In custom partitioning (used in Q8 below), we create a custom partition key and nest it along with our key/value pair. We then use the custom key to force partitioning based on user logic. A secondary sort on the second key would then allow the reducer logic to work effectively. Using custom partitioning and composite key concept, we can push certain keys (like TOTAL WORD COUNT) to be available to all the reducers.    \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ An order inversion is the mechanism where the data going into the reducer is sorted in such a way that aggregate count is calculated first. For example, in Naive Bayes word counting problem, we need to find the \"total words per class\" first, before we can calculate conditional probabilities. With order inversion, we emit a special character key representing the aggregate value (say '*'). This special character key is sorted and calculated first before the other word counts are done.\n"

    "# Question 3: Understanding Total Order Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge in distributed computing is to break a problem into a set of sub-problems that can be performed without communicating with each other. Ideally, we should be able to define an arbirtary number of splits and still get the right result, but that is not always possible. Parallelization becomes particularly challenging when we need to make comparisons between records, for example when sorting. Total Order Sort allows us to order large datasets in a way that enables efficient retrieval of results. Before beginning this assignment, make sure you have read and understand the [Total Order Sort Notebook](https://github.com/UCB-w261/main/tree/master/HelpfulResources/TotalSortGuide/_total-sort-guide-spark2.01-JAN27-2017.ipynb).

    "* Partial sort is the default behavior of Hadoop mapreduce framework. In partial sort, the data is sorted within each partition. However, there is no sorting across the partitions. For example, partition 1 may have key IDs 10,8,5,2, partition 2 may have key IDs 11,7,4,1 and so on. Within the partition, the information is sorted, however across the partitions it is not.\n",
    "* In an unordered total sort we use custom partition keys to make sure that we have \"key ranges\" landing on different partitions. However, there is no guarantee that first partition has the highest key ID followed by the second partition and so on.

Next we'll develop the code to do that same training in parallel, making it suitable for use with larger corpora (like the Enron emails). The end result of the MapReduce job you write in this question should be a model text file that looks just like the example (`NBmodel.txt`) that we created by hand above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refresh your memory about the training process take a look at  `6a` and `6b` where you described the pieces of information you'll need to collect in order to encode a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. We now want to retrieve those pieces of information while streaming over a corpus. The bulk of the task will be very similar to the word counting excercises you've already done but you may want to consider a slightly different key-value record structure to efficiently tally counts for each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging (interesting?) design question will be how to retrieve the totals (# of documents and # of words in documents for each class). Of course, counting these numbers is easy. The hard part is the timing: you'll need to make sure you have the counts totalled up _before_ you start estimating the class conditional probabilities for each word. It would be best (i.e. most scalable) if we could find a way to do this tallying without storing the whole vocabulary in memory... Use an appropriate MapReduce design pattern to implement this efficiently! \n",

    "* __a) make a plan:__  Fill in the docstrings for __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ to appropriately reflect the format that each script will input/output. [`HINT:` _the input files_ (`enronemail_1h.txt` & `chineseTrain.txt`) _have a prespecified format and your output file should match_ `NBmodel.txt` _so you really only have to decide on an internal format for Hadoop_].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) implement it:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ so that together they train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model __with no smoothing__. Make sure your end result is formatted correctly (see note above). Test your scripts independently and together (using `chineseTrain.txt` or test input of your own devising). When you are satisfied with your Python code design and run a Hadoop streaming command to run your job in parallel on the __chineseTrain.txt__. Confirm that your trained model matches your hand calculations from Question 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ We saw in Question 6 that adding Laplace +1 smoothing makes our classifications less sensitve to rare words. However implementing this technique requires access to one additional piece of information that we had not previously used in our Naive Bayes training. What is that extra piece of information? [`HINT:` see equation 13.7 in Manning, Raghavan and Schutze].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ There are three approaches that we could take to handle the extra piece of information you identified in `c`: 1) we could hard code it into our reducer (_where would we get it in the first place?_). Or 2) we could compute it inside the reducer which would require storing some information in memory (_what information?_). Or 3) we could compute it in the reducer without storing any bulky information in memory but then we'd need some postprocessing or a second MapReduce job to complete the calculation (_why?_). Breifly explain what is non-ideal about each of these options. BONUS: which of these options is incompatible with using multiple reducers?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ Choose one of the 3 options above. State your choice & reasoning in the space below then use that strategy to complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer_smooth.py`__. Test this alternate reducer then write and run a Hadoop streaming job to train an MNB model with smoothing on the Chinese example. Your results should match the model that we provided for you above (and the calculations in the textbook example). [`HINT:` _don't start from scratch with this one -- you can just copy over your reducer code from part `b` and make the needed modifications_]."

    "> __ c)__ We need the vocabulary size which we did not account for in the previous question.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __ d)__ If we hard-code it in our reducer, we need to have a prior knowledge of vocabulary words. In large corpus, I think we can just take standard vocabulary from GLOVE or Word2Vec with fixed size (say 60K) for hard coding. For option 2 and 3, we need to count the exact unique words from our training data. Calculating the vocab size dynamically need to be done at the reducer. Option 2 will break if we have multiple reducers, since we will not get all the words in a single reducer. Option 3 is the best in my opinion, which involves pre-processing of information or another map-reduce task. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __ e)__ I wrote code to calculate the vocab size offline (as part of EDA). I am passing this as an argument to the reducer in the stream job. I have written the code to dynamically check the number of reducers that are passed. Since the number of reducers can be more than one, I could not go for in-memory vocab size calculation in the reducer. \n"

    "\n",
    "Fantastic work. We're finally ready to perform Spam Classification on the Enron Corpus. In this question you'll run the analysis you've developed, report its performance, and draw some conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) train/test split:__ Run the provided code to split our Enron file into a training set and testing set then load them into HDFS. \n",
    "\n",
    "[`NOTE:` _If you hard coded the vocab size in question 8d make sure you re calculate the vocab size for just the training set!_]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) train 2 models:__ Write Hadoop Streaming jobs to train MNB Models on the training set with and without smoothing. Save your models to local files at __`NaiveBayes/Unsmoothed/NBmodel.txt`__ and __`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.txt`__. [`NOTE:` _This naming is important because we wrote our classification task so that it expects a file of that name... if this inelegance frustrates you there is an alternative that would involve a few adjustments to your code [read more about it here](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-11-23)._] Finally run the checks that we provide to confirm that your results are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Recall that we designed our classification job with just a mapper. An efficient way to report the performance of our models would be to simply add a reducer phase to this job and compute precision and recall right there. Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/evaluation_reducer.py`__ and then write Hadoop jobs to evaluate your two models on the test set. Report their performance side by side. [`NOTE:` if you need a refresher on precision, recall and F1-score [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is a good resource.]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ Compare the performance of your two models. What do you notice about the unsmoothed model's predictions? Can you guess why this is happening? Which evaluation measure do you think is most relevant in our use case? [`NOTE:` _Feel free to answer using your common sense but if you want more information on evaluating the classification task checkout_ [this blogpost](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2013/03/25/why-accuracy-alone-bad-measure-classification-tasks-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/\n",

    ")]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ Let's look at the top ten words with the highest conditional probability in `Spam` and in `Ham`. We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __f) short response:__ What do you notice about the 'top words' we printed in `e`? How would increasing the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the probabilities for the top words that you identified for 'e'. How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set. We don't recommend doing this exploration with the Enron data because it will be harder to see the impact with such a big vocabulary_]"

    "### Q9 Student Answers:\n",
    "> __d)__ The unsmoothed model gives pretty bad metrics because of the new words appearing in the test set that do not exist in the training set. The most relevant metrics for our use case are recall and F-Score. Precision is a bad choice, because it only depends on the TP & FP scores. Because of the missing values, the model did not predict too many positives (only 1 TP and 0 FP), thus making the precision very good. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ The mapper model_sort_mapper.py is adding two additional columns: 'ham/spam' and 'conditional probability'. This allows us to first sort based on ham/spam prediction and then secondary sort on the probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __f)__ I notice that the top outputs of ham and spam are very common words with very similar conditional probabilities. Increasing 'K' will have minimal impact on words that have huge difference in conditional probabilities of ham and spam. If we look at classPriors, it has more ham than spam. So, increasing K will move conditional probabilities of words more towards spam than to ham. So, if there is a word that is declared as 'ham' but the delta between ham/spam is very less (as we saw with common words), increasing the K might change their max probability towards spam. For the words like 'enron' and 'hou' which occur much more in ham than in spam, increasing K might not change the final outcome."

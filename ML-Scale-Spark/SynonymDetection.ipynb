    "# HW 3 - Synonym Detection In Spark\n",
    "__`MIDS w261: Machine Learning at Scale | UC Berkeley School of Information | Fall 2018`__\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last homework assignment you performed Naive Bayes to classify documents as 'ham' or 'spam.' In doing so, we relied on the implicit assumption that the list of words in a document can tell us something about the nature of that document's content. We'll rely on a similar intuition this week: the idea that, if we analyze a large enough corpus of text, the list of words that appear in small window before or after a vocabulary term can tell us something about that term's meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be your first assignment working in Spark. You'll perform Synonym Detection by repurposing an algorithm commonly used in Natural Language Processing to perform document similarity analysis. In doing so you'll also become familiar with important datatypes for efficiently processing sparse vectors and a number of set similarity metrics (e.g. Cosine, Jaccard, Dice). By the end of this homework you should be able to:  \n",
    "* ... __define__ the terms `one-hot encoding`, `co-occurrance matrix`, `stripe`, `inverted index`, `postings`, and `basis vocabulary` in the context of both synonym detection and document similarity analysis.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ the reasoning behind using a word stripe to compare word meanings.\n",
    "* ... __identify__ what makes set-similarity calculations computationally challenging.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ stateless algorithms in Spark to build stripes, inverted index and compute similarity metrics.\n",
    "* ... __apply__ appropriate metrics to assess the performance of your synonym detection algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__`NOTE`__: your reading assignment for weeks 5 and 6 were fairly heavy and you may have glossed over the papers on dimension independent similarity metrics by [Zadeh et al](http://stanford.edu/~rezab/papers/disco.pdf) and pairwise document similarity by [Elsayed et al](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~oard/pdf/acl08elsayed2.pdf).

    "### Q1 Student Answers:\n",
    "> __a)__ Apache Spark is an opensource distribution that provides a mechanism for fast and expressive distributed cluster computing framework. Traditional Hadoop MapReduce programs read input data from disk, map a function across the data, reduce the results of the map, and store the results on the disk. Reading or writing to the disk often results in inefficiencies for massive amounts of data. Spark provides mechanisms to store the results in-memory thereby resulting in increased speeds and efficiencies which can sometimes be as high as 100X faster than Hadoop mapreduce. Spark also provides multiple APIs to interface like Java, Scala (Spark was built on Scala), Python and R. Spark's built in libraries for machine learning, graph processing and database management makes it very efficient to write code in less number of lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Functional programming is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. The only access to the data is what the function returns. Spark allows sharing the state through two types of variables, broadcast variable and accumulators. Broadcast variable is a read-only variable cached on each machine that is accesible to every task. Accumulators are type of variables that are added to and can be used for counters/sums. The shared variable concept breaks one principle of functional programming which is side effect (state change that is observable outside the called function).However, Spark maintains the essence of functional programming through higher order functions such as map, reduce and several other functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ DAG is Directed Acylic Graph that represents consecutive computation stages. When we write a Spark program, it consists of an RDD from input data, a series of transformations, filters and actions. These are performed in several stages and DAG provides a logical representation of these operations. When a driver runs the program, it converts the logical graph to physical execution plan. Using DAG we can interpret if our Spark code has inefficiencies (multiple stages involving shuffle etc.).  \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ cache() helps in caching the RDD into memory and helps in faster processing. Spark operations are lazy, which means a given RDD is not accessed until an action is called. In a linear lineage, an RDD is accessed, transformation is performed and the result is used. If we never have a need of accessing the same RDD again, then caching is not needed. However, if our code branches into several functions and each of them is accessing the same RDD several times, caching it helps in speeding things. Cache itself is a lazy operation, i.e, until the first action is called, nothing happens. After an RDD is accessed first time, it is cached so that subsequent calls to the RDD will load the data from the cache. A general rule of thumb is to use cache when we are accessing the RDD multiple times (like in a loop).\n",

    "# Question 2: Similarity Metrics\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction to this assignment, an intuitive way to compare the meaning of two documents is to compare the list of words they contain. Given a vocabulary $V$ (feature set) we would represent each document as a vector of `1`-s and `0`-s based on whether or not it contains each word in $V$. These \"one-hot encoded\" vector representations allow us to use math to identify similar documents. However like many NLP tasks the high-dimensionality of the feature space is a challenge... especially when we start to scale up the size and number of documents we want to compare.\n",

    "## Question 3: Synonym Detection Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Synonym Detection task we want to compare the meaning of words, not documents. For clarity, lets call the words whose meaning we want to compare `terms`. If only we had a 'meaning document' for each `term` then we could easily use the document similarity strategy from Question 2 to figure out which `terms` have similar meaning (i.e. are 'synonyms'). Of course in order for that to work we'd have to reasonably believe that the words in these 'meaning documents' really do reflect the meaning of the `term`. For a good analysis we'd also need these 'meaning documents' to be fairly long -- the one or two sentence dictionary definition of a term isn't going to provide enough signal to distinguish between thousands and thousands of `term` meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the idea of co-occurrance comes in. Just like DocSim makes the assumption that words in a document tell us about the document's meaning, we're going to assume that the set of words that 'co-occur' within a small window around our term can tell us some thing about the meaning of that `term`. Remember that we're going to make this 'co-words' list (a.k.a. 'stripe') by looking at a large body of text. This stripe is our 'meaning document' in that it reflects all the kinds of situations in which our `term` gets used in real language. So another way to phrase our assumption is: we think `terms` that get used to complete lots of the same phrases probably have related meanings. This may seem like an odd assumption but computational linguists have found that it works surprisingly well in practice. Let's look at a toy example to build your intuition for why and how.\n",

    "# Question 4: Pairs and Stripes at Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "As you read in the paper by Zadeh et al, the advantage of metrics like Cosine, Dice, Overlap and Jaccard is that they are dimension independent -- that is to say, if we implement them in a smart way the computational complexity of performing these computations is independent of the number of documents we want to compare (or in our case, the number of terms that are potential synonyms). One component of a 'smart implementation' involves thinking carefully both about how you define the \"basis vocabulary\" that forms your feature set (removing stopwords, etc). Another key idea is to use a data structure that facilitates distributed calculations. The DISCO implemetation further uses a sampling strategy, but that is beyond the scope of this assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question we'll take a closer look at the computational complexity of the synonym detection approach we took in question 3 and then revist the document similarity example as a way to explore a more efficient approach to parallelizing this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4 Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ In question 3 you calculated the cosine similarity of pairs of words using the vector representation of their co-occurrences in a corpus. Imagine for now that you have unlimited memory on each of your nodes and describe a sequence of map & reduce steps that would start from a raw corpus and reproduce your strategy from Q3. Be specific. For each step be sure to note what information would be stored in memory on your nodes and what information would need to be shuffled over the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ In the asynch videos about \"Pairs and Stripes\" you were introduced to an alternative strategy. Explain two ways that using these data structures are more efficient than 1-hot encoded vectors when it comes to distributed similarity calculations [__`HINT:`__ _Consider memory constraints, amount of information being shuffled, amount of information being transfered over the network, and level of parallelization._]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) read provided code:__ The code below provides a streamined implementation of Document similarity analysis in Spark. Read through this code carefully. Once you are confident you understand how it works, answer the remaining questions. [__`TIP:`__ _to see the output of each transformation try commenting out the subsequent lines and adding an early `collect()` action_.]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ The second mapper function, `splitWords`, emits 'postings'. The list of all 'postings' for a word is also refered to as an 'inverted index'. Define each of these terms based on your reading of the provided code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) short response:__ The third mapper, `makeCompositeKeys`, loops over the inverted index to emit 'pairs' of what? Explain what information is included in the composite key created at this stage and why it makes sense to synchronize around that information in the context of performing document similarity calculations. In addition to the information included in these new keys, what other piece of information will we need to compute Jaccard or Cosine similarity?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __f) short response:__ Out of all the Spark transformations we make in this analysis, which are 'wide' transformations and which are 'narrow' transformations. Explain."

    "### Q4 Student Answers:\n",
    "> __a)__ I would attempt a  Hadoop MR job as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mappers  : Input is raw corpus of documents. Output of each mapper is in the form of Word and document id - ex: W1:{docA}\n",
    "* Shuffle : The mapper outputs above will be shuffled with word as key\n",
    "* Reducers : Aggregate word as key and build a final list of each word - ex: W1:{docA,docC,docD},W2:{docA,docB} and convert it to one-hot format. The output in one-hot format is W1:{1,0,1,0,0...}\n",
    "* Mappers : Send the output of the previous result from the reducer to another set of mappers which will emit pair-wise one-hot vector. ex: W1,W2 : {1,0,1,0,0..}{1,1,0,0,0..}\n",
    "* Shuffle : Sort by word pair and send to a reducer\n",
    "* Reducer (single) : Compute similarity from the one-hot vectors recieved from all the pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ The alternative approach to pairs is stripes model. For example, instead of the pairs approach above, we should emit in the format word and its neighbors: W1:{'W2','W3',..}, W2:{'W1','W4',..} etc. The reducers can construct the one-hot encoded vectors from the stripes as shown in Q3 and calculate the cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ _read provided code before answering d-f_ \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ The mapper splitWords emits a word and its location (document ID). We can view 'posting' as a document_index where a given word is present. List of such postings is refered as as inverted index. Refering to our example below, an inverted index for 'bright' is [docA,docB,docC] where each document is a posting. This is 'inverted' because the other form is to have a documennt as key and words present as values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ makeCompsiteKeys emits pairs of \"documents\" that contain common words. From the postings of words, we can find pair of documents that contain same word and emit such pairs. We can then aggregate these counts for every pair. At the end of the reduction step (reduceByKey), we have pair of documents with number of common words between them and also individual word total per each document.This information is good enough to construct the vectors and compute jaccard/cosine similarities. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __f)__ map,flatMap are narrow transformations as they operate only on individual elements. reduceByKey and takeOrdered are wide transformations as they need the entire RDD to perform the aggregation (reduceByKey) and ordering across the partitions."

    "Now that you are comfortable with similarity metrics we turn to the main task in this assignment: Synonym Detection. As you saw in Question 3 the ability of our algorithm to detect words with similar meanings is highly dependent on our input text. Specifically, we need a large enough corpus of natural language that we can expose our algorithm to a realistic range of contexts in which in any given word might get used. Ideally, these 'contexts' would also provide enough signal to distinguish between words with similar semantic roles but different meaning. Finding such a corpus will be easier to accomplish for some words than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the main task in this portion of the homework you will use data from Google's n-gram corpus. This data is particularly convenient for our task because Google has already done the first step for us: they windowed over a large subset of the web and extracted all 5-grams. If you are interested in learning more about this dataset the original source is: http://books.google.com/ngrams/, and a large subset is available [here from AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/datasets/google-books-ngrams/). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we have provided a subset of the 5-grams data consisting of 191 files of approximately 10MB each. These files are available on dropbox at: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tmqpc4o0xswhkvz/AACUifrl6wrMrlK6a3X3lZ9Ea\n",
    "... below we provide the code to download these files. Please only use the provided data so that we can ensure consistent results from student to student.\n",

    "Each row in our dataset represents one of these 5 grams in the format:\n",
    "> `(ngram) \\t (count) \\t (pages_count) \\t (books_count)`\n",
    "\n",
    "__DISCLAIMER__: In real life, we would calculate the stripes cooccurrence data from the raw text by windowing over the raw text and not from the 5-gram preprocessed data.  Calculating pairs on this 5-gram is a little corrupt as we will be double counting cooccurences. Having said that this exercise can still pull out some similar terms. "

    "\n",
    "The computational complexity of synonym analysis depends not only on the number of words, but also on the number of co-ocurrences each word has. In this question you'll take a closer look at that aspect of our data. As before, please test each job on small \"systems test\" (Dickens ngrams) file and on a single file from the Ngram dataset before running the full analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) code:__ Write a spark job that computes:\n",
    "  * the number of unique neighbors (i.e. 5-gram co-occuring words) for each word in the vocabulary. \n",
    "  * the top 10 words with the most \"neighbors\"\n",
    "  * the bottom 10 words with least \"neighbors\"\n",
    "  * a random sample of 1% of the words' neighbor counts  \n",
    "  __`NOTE:`__ for the last item, please return only the counts and not the words -- we'll go on to use these in a plotting function that expects a list of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ Use the provided code to plot a histogram of the sampled list from `a`. Comment on the distribution you observe. How will this distribution affect our synonym detection analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code + short response:__ Write a Spark Job to compare the top/bottom words from Q5 and from part a. Specifically, what % of the 1000 most/least neighbors words also appear in the list of 1000 most/least frequent words. [__`NOTE:`__ _technically these lists are short enough to comparing in memory on your local machine but please design your Spark job as if we were potentially comparing much larger lists._]"

In this question, you'll choose a judicious subset of these words to form our 'basis vocabulary' (i.e. feature set). Practically speaking, this means that when we build our stripes, we are only going to keep track of when a term co-occurs with one of these basis words. \n",

    "> __a)__ Since most frequent words will have a tendency to co-occur with many terms, we will end up with wrong synonyms, just like how we got antonyms as synonyms in Q3e. I would consider using most frequent words as overfitting. If we use less frequent words as vocab, we may have some words that may not have any neighbors associated with the BASIS vocab. So, we will have less synonyms and some words may not return any synonym. In my view, this is similar to underfitting (too few useful features). \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ If we have much larger dataset, we can randomly pick a sample based on the number of occurences, removing the words which occur say <3 times etc. Since we generally have a long tail of occurences, having such a randomized strategy to pick words would still give us accurate results.\n"
